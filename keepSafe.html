<h3>How to keep yourself Safe!</h3>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Wash your hands frequently</h4><p>Regularly and thoroughly <b>clean your hands</b> with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.</p></li>
  <li><h4>Maintain social distancing</h4><p>Maintain <b>at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance</b> between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing so that  <br>you don't inhale or come in direct contact with a person's droplets containing the virus.</p></li>
  <li><h4>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h4><p>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,<br> nose or mouth. From there, <b>the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</b></p></li>
  <li><h4>Practice respiratory hygiene - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue while sneezing or coughing</h4><p>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means <b>covering your mouth  <br> and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze</b>. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.</p></li>
  <li><h4>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</h4><p>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call <br>in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.</p></li>
  <li><h4>Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider</h4><p>Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national<br> brand local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p></li>
